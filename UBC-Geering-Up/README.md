# About this workshop

## Teaching Data Science Remotely (Grades 5 – 12) – Hosted by Callysto
We live in a data-driven world. 
Teaching students how to understand and use technology to work with data is an in-demand skill. 
If you’re a Grades 5-12 teacher interested in incorporating open data and data science – including coding, data analysis and 
visualization– into your online lessons, join this webinar! 
Data science experts from the federally-funded Callysto project will lead you through this interactive session. 
In this introductory webinar, you’ll learn how to teach students in-demand digital workforce skills (data science), 
how to use open data sources in your classroom, how to integrate Callysto’s free, online, curriculum-tied notebooks 
in your lessons, and gain insights into how data science can be applied across a variety of subjects. 
Please note that you will need a Google or Microsoft email to access the platform, 
and that no prior coding experience is necessary.
